	My dear little Touko,
		It's me! Your lovely rokiya.
		Welcome to Github! I hope you can like this place -- that we will build together.	
		
		Here's a little task for you:
		1. Learn a Pull Request in Github.
		This is the code I write for my homework. 
		Now You're going to approve my code and celebrate one of the hard homework I just done!
		I'm super excited!
		
		Do the following:
			1.1 Come here: https://github.com/GindaChen/ME759-HW/pull/2
			1.2 Add your review (just random comments)
			1.3 Click "Merge pull request".
			1.4 (Optional) Click "Delete Branch"
			
		Whenever you done the task, I will know by email. And you're excellent first step (instead of a stupid plain hello-world project like others) will be recorded in the Github forever!
		
		Hope you like it?
		
	Always love you,
	Rokiya
